          <h1>How much fruit should you eat per day?</h1>
          <p>Fruit is an important part of a healthy diet.</p>
          <p>In fact, diets high in fruit are associated with all sorts of health benefits, including a decreased risk of many diseases.</p>
          <p>However, some people are concerned with the sugar content of fruit and worry that eating too much of it may be harmful.</p>
          <p>Eating whole fruit promotes good health and can lower the risk of many serious diseases.</p>
          <p>Unless you are following a ketogenic diet or have some sort of intolerance, there really is no reason to limit the amount of fruit you eat.</p>
          <p>While most studies suggest that the optimal amount is two to five servings of fruit per day, there seems to be no harm in eating more.</p>


          <h1>Nutritional Values</h1>
          <p>Fresh fruits are generally high in fiber, vitamin C, and water.</p>
          <p>Regular consumption of fruit is generally associated with reduced risks of several diseases and functional declines associated with aging.</p>
